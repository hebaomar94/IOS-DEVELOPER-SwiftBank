# IOS-DEVELOPER-SwiftBank
We’ll use properties and access control to build a structure that represents a secure personal bank account. We will be able to initialize the account with a password and initial deposit, make deposits, make withdrawals, and check the balance.

For our bank to remain competitive and earn lots of new customers, we will offer a cash bonus every time a user makes a deposit. Additionally, we’ll configure a property observer to let us know whenever our bank balance is set so that we can display alerts.
